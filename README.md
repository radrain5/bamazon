I was created the Database and the Table and Columns with data and was able to get them to display in the terminal.  I've tried to create a function using "inquirer" to prompt the user for the ID of the item they would like to purchase, but for some reason, I can't get it to work.

I would need a function to take the ID from the Customer and then pull that item from the list.  I would need to create a .then function to ask them how many of the item they would like to buy.

Then, I would need to a function to check the inventory of that particular item to see if I could accomodate the order, if yes, message "your order has been filled", if the request was too high, would message "sorry, your order could not be filled."
